# Goldfish

A highly opinionated [The Pomodoro Technique][the-pomodoro-technique] macOS
timer.

## Why?

Several years ago I wrote a [blog post][blog-post] about how I use Todoist and
[The Pomodoro Technique][the-pomodoro-technique] together to help me focus,
avoid burnouts, and be productive.

For a long time I used Pomodoro Timer from Nasa Trained Monkeys, and I really
liked it. But there were two things that bothered me:

- I don't use fixed breaks because I usually have to leave my desk between
  Pomodoros.
- I wanted a simple reminder that a Pomodoro is about to finish so I can start
  wrapping up.

Since no timer was an exact fit for me and because I use it every day, I decided
to write my own.

## Features

- Highly opinionated, no configuration.
- No useless GUIs to handle Pomodoros or tasks.
- Only Start/Stop. Pausing a Pomodoro is cheating.
- No break timer. Take all the time you need after finishing.
- Subtle bell sound when the Pomodoro is about to finish.
- Annoying alarm sound when the Pomodoro finishes.

## Why Goldfish?

According to [Statistic Brain][statistic-brain] the average attention span of a
goldfish is 9 seconds and the average attention span of a person is 8.2 seconds.
Sad.

Hopefully, Goldfish can help you focus on a single task longer than a goldfish
can.
